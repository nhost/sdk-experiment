# Intro

This repository is being used to develop a new version of the nhost-js SDK and to provide examples on how to use it.

The goals are to develop and easy to maintain and easy to use SDK that can be used in any JS/TS environment.

# Structure

- `/backend`: This folder contains an Nhost backend for testing purposes.
- `/demos`: This folder contains various demos. Each demo is a separate folder and contains a README file with instructions on how to run it, what it does and where the interesting parts are. The demos are meant to test the SDKs and show how to use them.
- `/docs`: This folder contains Nhost's documentation. This is the the same as https://docs.nhost.io but modified for the new SDK and with guides on how to leverage the to build various workflows. The README contains instructions on how to run the documentation locally and which documents are new and need to be reviewed.
- `/packages`: This folder contains the SDKs. Each SDK is in its own folder and contains a README file with details and instructions.

# Notes

We use pnpm and workspaces to be able to quickly build and use the new SDK directly in the demos without having to publish it.

# Developing demos

When developing demos:

- The focus should be on the new SDK so everything else should be clean and simple to avoid confusing users.
- Always use the SDKs in the `packages` folder
- Avoid external dependencies if possible
